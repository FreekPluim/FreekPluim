<h1>Freek Pluim</h1>

I am newly graduated from Saxion University of Applied Science at the study "Creative Media and Game Technology". 

## Previous experience
From Febuary to July of 2024 i worked at Saxion XR Lab, working on a multitude of serious games for Enschede Promotie, Leiden Universiteit medisch centrum and others. 
Most of these games where made in Unreal Engine with a few being made in Unity.

## Projects
<h3><a href="https://tygoh.itch.io/tweeduuster-vertical-slice">Shadows of Singraven</a></h3>
This project was created by me as programmer and 9 other students. The game was created for Project Tweeduuster, a project set up by a previous teacher of mine. It aims to bring back old folklore and myths from the Twente region of The Netherlands by bringing it to new media like AR apps or video games. The game is a vertical slice of a small, non-linear, puzzle, horror game about The nun of Singraven.

<h3><a href="https://s4lt1.itch.io/call-for-action">Call for Action</a></h3>
This game was created by me as a solo dev during a gamejam hosted by study assosiation XP. In the game, you work for a company where you just have to do small tasks on a board. Think pressing a button or rotating a dial to the correct possition. As days go on you need to complete more tasks. This might become overwhelming, if that is the case you just need to remember, "You can always call 6".

## What am i working on
<h3>Roguelike (Working title)</h3>
This is the game I am currently working on. It is a 3D, top-down, rogue-like, strategy game with turnbased combat. It is currently not in a playable state

<h3>Bartender (Working title)</h3>
In this game, you play as a bartender, making sure that people are of the right age to drink, which can be dificult when elves age differently than humand. And styling the bar how you would like.

<h3>School project rework</h3>
I am also reworking a game i created in a group project in 2022. This game connects your phone to a game and uses it as a steering wheel for a karting game. This is playable with up to 4 players.
